# Haplotype Network Complexity Script #
# estimates complexity of haplotype networks 
# by combining indices of genetic and topological diversity


# Use this script to build haplotype networks and calculate:

# Nucleotide diversity (Pi)                 = a measurement of the genetic distance between sequences
# Haplotype diversity (Hd)                  = a measurement of the genetic diversity in a population
# Branch diversity (Bd)                     = a new measurement of the topological diversity in a haplotype network or the diversity of interrelationships among the observed haplotypes in a population
# Haplotype Network Branch diversity (HBd)  = a new measurement of the complexity in a haplotype network

# Additional calculations:

# Number of individuals (n)
# Number of haplotypes (nH)
# Number of haplotype classes (nHc)
# Frequency of haplotype classes (niHc)


# You will need:

# 1.- a fasta file with your sequences
# 2.- a file with site info (optional). 
# The site file consists of a .csv file with the sample names in the first column and site names in the second. 
# Call these columns "sample" and "site", respectively. Save the file as "sites.csv"
# All metrics can still be calculated without any site information (see below)

# Since our metrics are not affected by site information, 
# it is possible to create a data frame giving sites the same names 
# as the samples, making each site unique. 
# This guarantees that every sequence will always have a site match allowing the script to run.
# The following code will create this data frame. 
# Do not run this line if you have already generated a sites object above or it will be overwritten.
